# CarExpenseTracker

This service is designed for **tracking, viewing, and managing car-related expenses** such as fuel, maintenance, parking, insurance, and other automobile costs.

It provides users with tools to **add, edit, and analyze expenses**, visualize statistics through charts, and export spending reports in **JSON (and in future — PDF)** format.

The application is developed for **Android devices (version 12 and higher)** and aims to help drivers maintain clear financial control over their vehicle maintenance and operation costs.

In the future, it is planned to **integrate with a PostgreSQL database** deployed on an external server to enable data synchronization and backup.
